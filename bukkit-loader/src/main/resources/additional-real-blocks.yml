# This file will register an additional number of block states to the server, based on the mappings defined in mappings.yml.
# If you're unsure what this means, you can read the following explanation below.

# Suppose you create a new type of leaf, but its appearance has only two states (waterlogged and normal).
# However, because of the defined properties such as distance, persistent, and waterlogged, it requires at least 2x2x7 = 28 different block states.
# By default, the plugin only registers the same number of block states as those defined in the mappings.yml file.
# Therefore, during actual configuration, you will notice that the internal IDs are insufficient
# (without configuring additional-real-block, one type of leaf can only provide 26 states, whereas creating a new leaf requires 28 states).
# The purpose of this file is to register additional block states with the server when starting it, ensuring the correct mapping between real blocks and the visual appearance of fake blocks on the server.

# Some common questions:
# Q: Do I need to restart the server for the changes to take effect?
# A: Yes! Modifying the block registry while the server is running is extremely risky.
# Q: When do I need to configure this file?
# A: When the number of real block IDs is insufficient, but there are still available appearances.

# By default, the plugin only registers an additional 112 oak leaf block states (for the default configuration needs [>=28 states]).
