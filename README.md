## 📌 About CraftEngine
CraftEngine redefines plugin architecture as a next-generation solution for custom content implementation. Its JVM-level injection delivers unprecedented performance, stability, and extensibility. The framework provides a code-first API for registering natively integrated block behaviors and item interaction logic.

## Build
Getting the full jar is completely free, as long as you have a device with jdk21 installed. Follow the guide below to build it.

### 🐚 Command Line
+ Start terminal and change directory to the project folder.
+ Execute "./gradlew build" and get the artifact under /target folder.

### 💻 IDE
+ Import the project and execute gradle build action.
+ Get the artifact under /target folder.

## Installation

### 💻 Enviroment Requirements
+ First, ensure that you are running a [Paper](https://papermc.io/)/[Folia](https://github.com/PaperMC/Folia) (or its fork) 1.20.1+ server. The plugin does not support Spigot and is unlikely to do so in the future.
+ Secondly, please use JDK 21 to run the server. I believe this is quite straightforward for you.

### 🔍 How to Install
CraftEngine offers two installation modes: Standard Installation and Mod Mode. As the name suggests, Standard Installation involves placing the plugin into your plugins folder just like any conventional plugin. Below, we will provide a detailed explanation on how to install using mod mode.

### 🔧 Install Server Mod
- Download the latest [ignite.jar](https://github.com/vectrix-space/ignite/releases) into your server's root directory
- Either:
    - Rename your server JAR to `paper.jar` and modify startup command to: `-jar ignite.jar`
- Or:
    - Use advanced launch arguments 
       - For paper/folia: `-Dignite.locator=paper -Dignite.paper.jar=./server-xxx.jar -jar ignite.jar` 
       - For some special paper forks `-Dignite.locator=paper -Dignite.paper.target=cn.dreeam.leaper.QuantumLeaper -Dignite.paper.jar=./leaf-xxx.jar -jar ignite.jar`
- Start the server to generate the `/mods` directory
- Place the latest [mod.jar](https://github.com/Xiao-MoMi/craft-engine/releases) in `/mods`
- Install the plugin by placing its JAR in `/plugins`
- Perform two restarts:
    1. Initial restart for file initialization
    2. Final restart to activate all components

## Technical Overview

### ⚙️ Blocks
The plugin employs runtime bytecode generation to register custom blocks at the server-native level, combined with client-side data packet modification for visual synchronization. This architecture provides:

🧱 Native Block Customization
+ Dynamically register blocks with complete control over
+ Physics: hardness, flammability, light emission, etc.
+ Custom Behaviors: Tree saplings, crops, falling blocks, and more via API
+ Vanilla Compatibility: Full preservation of vanilla block mechanism (e.g., note blocks, tripwires)

📦 Data Pack Integration
+ Define custom ore veins
+ Generate custom trees
+ Configure custom terrain generation

⚡ Performance Advantages
+ Significantly faster and stabler than traditional Bukkit event listeners
+ Strategic code injection for minimal overhead

### 🥘 Recipes
CraftEngine implements a fully customizable crafting system via low-level injection. Unlike conventional plugins that fail with NBT modifications, it ensures resilient handling of item metadata - recipe outcomes remain exclusively tied to unique item identifiers.

### 🪑 Furniture
The plugin utilizes a core entity to store furniture metadata, while transmitting collision entities and modular components as client-bound packets. This architecture achieves significant server-side performance optimization, while supporting composite furniture assembly through multi-part item integration.

### 📝 Templates
Given the extensive and intricate nature of plugin configurations, a modular template system is implemented to compartmentalize critical settings. This enables user-customizable configuration formats while significantly minimizing redundant YAML definitions.

### 🛠️ Models
The plugin enables model inheritance and texture overrides through configuration, while supporting [all item models](https://misode.github.io/assets/item/) from version 1.21.4 onward. It incorporates a version migration system that automatically downgrades 1.21.4+ item models to legacy formats with maximum backward compatibility.

## Inspired Projects
This project draws inspiration from the following open-source works:
+ [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper)
+ [LuckPerms](https://github.com/LuckPerms/LuckPerms)
+ [Fabric](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric)
+ [packetevents](https://github.com/retrooper/packetevents)
+ [NBT](https://github.com/Querz/NBT)
+ [DataFixerUpper](https://github.com/Mojang/DataFixerUpper)
+ [ViaVersion](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaVersion)

### Core Dependencies
The implementation relies on these fundamental libraries:
+ [ignite](https://github.com/vectrix-space/ignite)
+ [cloud-minecraft](https://github.com/Incendo/cloud-minecraft)
+ [rtag](https://github.com/saicone/rtag)
