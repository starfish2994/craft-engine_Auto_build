## 📌 About CraftEngine
CraftEngine redefines Minecraft plugin architecture as a next-generation solution for custom content implementation. Its JVM-level injection delivers unprecedented performance, stability, and extensibility. The framework provides a code-first API for registering natively integrated block behaviors and item interaction logic.

## Build

### 🐚 Command Line
+ Install JDK 21.
+ Start terminal and change directory to the project folder.
+ Execute "./gradlew build" and get the artifact under /target folder.

### 💻 IDE
+ Import the project and execute gradle build action.
+ Get the artifact under /target folder.

## Installation

### 💻 Enviroment Requirements
+ First, ensure that you are running a [Paper](https://papermc.io/) (or its fork) 1.20.1+ server. The plugin does not support Spigot and is unlikely to do so in the future. CraftEngine contains over 10,000 lines of code that are based on the Minecraft code of the Paper version server.
+ Secondly, please use JDK 21 to run the server. I believe this is quite straightforward for you.

### 🔍 How to Install
CraftEngine offers two installation modes: Standard Installation and Mod Mode. As the name suggests, Standard Installation involves placing the plugin into your plugins folder just like any conventional plugin. Below, we will provide a detailed explanation on how to install using mod mode.

### 🔧 Install Server Mod
- Download the latest [ignite.jar](https://github.com/vectrix-space/ignite/releases) into your server's root directory
- Either:
    - Rename your server JAR to `paper.jar`
    - Add launch arguments: `-Dignite.locator=paper -Dignite.paper.jar=./paper-xxx.jar`
- Start the server to generate the `/mods` directory
- Place the latest [mod.jar](https://github.com/Xiao-MoMi/craft-engine/releases) in `/mods`
- Install the plugin by placing its JAR in `/plugins`
- Perform two restarts:
    1. Initial restart for file initialization
    2. Final restart to activate all components

## Technical Overview

### ⚙️ Blocks
The plugin employs runtime bytecode generation to register custom blocks at the server-native level, combined with client-side data packet modification for visual synchronization. This architecture provides:

🧱 Native Block Customization
+ Dynamically register blocks with complete control over
+ Physics: hardness, flammability, light emission, and all standard properties supported by vanilla Minecraft
+ Custom Behaviors: Tree saplings, crops, falling blocks, and more via API
+ Vanilla Compatibility: Full preservation of native block mechanics (e.g., note blocks, tripwires)

📦 Data Pack Integration
+ Define custom ore veins
+ Generate custom trees
+ Configure custom terrain generation

⚡ Performance Advantages
+ Significantly faster and stabler than traditional Bukkit event listeners
+ Strategic code injection for minimal overhead

### 🥘 Recipes
CraftEngine implements a fully customizable crafting system via low-level injection. Unlike conventional plugins that fail with NBT modifications, it ensures resilient handling of item metadata - recipe outcomes remain exclusively tied to unique item identifiers.

### 🪑 Furniture
The plugin utilizes a core entity to store furniture metadata, while transmitting collision entities and modular components as client-bound packets. This architecture achieves significant server-side performance optimization, while supporting composite furniture assembly through multi-part item integration.

### 📝 Templates
Given the extensive and intricate nature of plugin configurations, a modular template system is implemented to compartmentalize critical settings. This enables user-customizable configuration formats while significantly minimizing redundant YAML definitions.

### 🛠️ Models
The plugin enables model inheritance and texture overrides through configuration, while supporting [all item models](https://misode.github.io/assets/item/) from version 1.21.4 onward. It incorporates a version migration system that automatically downgrades 1.21.4+ item models to legacy formats with maximum backward compatibility.
